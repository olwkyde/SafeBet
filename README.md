## Overview
### Description
An app that would allow people to bet money (that isn't real) on sports events

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
- **Mobile:**
    - not very uniquely mobile, many gambling apps have a web version that similar in functionality
- **Story:**
    - it has value to people that are too scared to gamble with real money
    - i have talked to people who want to make bets but are too scared to lose money
- **Market:**
    - user base: people too young / too scared to gamble
    - lot of value to niche market
- **Habit:**
    - can be addicting the same way gambling is considered addicting
- **Scope:**
    - the app is difficult, but doable (I think) and as the functionality can be very basic, a stripped version is possible
